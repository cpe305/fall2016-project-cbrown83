	"santasNotes": "Hello it's Santa! I would like YOU to join me on my Christmas Eve adventure!\nI need help delivering presents to children all over the world. Join me in guiding my reindeer to 10 cities across the map to keep the Christmas spirit alive. Santa’s Christmas Adventure is a text based game lightly based off The Oregon Trail. At each city along the way, I have the options to view some famous landmarks and deliver presents. However, with 21st century tech-savvy children, delivering presents isn’t as easy as it once was. Are you up for the challenge? \n\nSanta’s Lessons Learned\nItems to take: \nCarrots (1lb) – Reindeer get hungry\nGingerbread men (2lb)– I get hungry\nHot Cocoa (3lb)– I also get thirsty\nSanta Hat (4lb)– An old noggin is cold noggin\nSanta Coat (5lb)– It is cold in the winter\nCandy Canes (10lb)– The only thing to distract children from technology is sugar, a lot of sugar\nSleigh parts (10lb)– 19th century sleighs require a lot of repairs\n\nAbout Sleigh Capacity:\nI, Santa, have no metabolism, so anything that I consumes is still accounted for when calculating the remaining capacity of the sleigh. However, once consumed, I will no longer have the item(s) in his inventory (as it is now in my stomach). The only way to increase the remaining capacity is to successfully deliver presents. If the sleigh capacity is maxed out and a random event occurs requiring me to consume an item that I do not have, my final score will reflect negative points. \nHere is some simple math: \nThe sleigh can hold 500lb.\nI weigh 250lb.\nThe presents weigh 200lb (sad that I weigh more than the presents). \n500 – 250 – 200 = 50lb remaining\nSO, I can take 50lb of additional items with me. Choose wisely. \n\nScoring: \nUpon returning to the North Pole, I will evaluate my success (or failure) in delivering presents. For every successful delivery, I reward myself 100 points. Then I take the weight of my left-over inventory in addition to the sleigh’s remaining capacity and adds that to the total. My best score to date is 550 points. Can you help me beat that?\n\n- Santa\n",
