Join Santa on his Christmas Eve adventure!
Santa needs help delivering presents to children all over the world. Join him in guiding his reindeer to 10 cities across the map to keep the Christmas spirit alive. Santa’s Christmas Adventure is a text based game lightly based off The Oregon Trail. At each city along the way, you have the options to view some famous landmarks and deliver presents. However, with 21st century tech-savvy children, delivering presents isn’t as easy as it once was. Are you up for the challenge? 

Game Play: 
Santa's Christmas Adventure is a text based game. To play the game, simply execute the Driver in a terminal or IDE of your choice. All user input is taken through the keyboard. *Press enter to process the input*. Feedback will be given upon invalid inputs. 

Scoring: 
Upon returning to the North Pole, Santa will evaluate his success (or failure) in delivering presents. For every successful delivery, Santa rewards himself 100 points. He then takes the weight of his left-over inventory in addition to the sleigh’s remaining capacity and adds that to the total. His best score to date is 550 points. Can you help him beat that?

Santa’s Lessons Learned - 
Items to take: 
Carrots (1lb) – Reindeer get hungry
Gingerbread men (2lb)– I get hungry
Hot Cocoa (3lb)– I also get thirsty 
Santa Hat (4lb)– An old noggin is cold noggin
Santa Coat (5lb)– It is cold in the winter
Candy Canes (10lb)– The only thing to distract children from technology is sugar, a lot of sugar
Sleigh parts (10lb)– 19th century sleighs require a lot of repairs

About Sleigh Capacity:
I, Santa, have no metabolism, so anything that I consumes is still accounted for when calculating the remaining capacity of the sleigh. However, once consumed, I will no longer have the item(s) in his inventory (as it is now in my stomach). The only way to increase the remaining capacity is to successfully deliver presents. If the sleigh capacity is maxed out and a random event occurs requiring me to consume an item that I do not have, my final score will reflect negative points. 
Here is some simple math: 
The sleigh can hold 500lb. 
I weigh 250lb. 
The presents weigh 200lb (sad that I weigh more than the presents). 
500 – 250 – 200 = 50lb remaining
SO, I can take 50lb of additional items with me. Choose wisely.
